# Changelog

Why bother with a changelog? I found several good reasons that aligns with my values and here are a few of them.
1.  It gives my audience an insider’s look into how the platform or brand is **evolving**.
2.  A public changelog aligns with values of **transparency** and sharing. Inviting people to see behind the curtain builds **trust**.
