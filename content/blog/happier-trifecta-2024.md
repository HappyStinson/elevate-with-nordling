## Introduction

I got the idea of writing a '24 for 24' list from [Gretchen Rubin](https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast/463-revealed-our-24-for-24-lists-of-24-big-and-small-things-we-want-to-accomplish-in-2024/ "Listen to Gretchen Rubin discuss her 24 for 2024 list on episode 463 of the Happier Podcast") as part of the [Happier Trifecta](https://gretchenrubin.com/getting-started-the-24-for-2024-trifecta/ "Explore resources for starting your 24 for 2024 journey with the Happier Trifecta").

This year's trifecta is:
- Write a list of 24 things, big or small, you'd like to get done this year.
- This year, write for 2 to 4 or 24 minutes each day.
- Choose one word or a short phrase to sum up what you want to focus on for the year.
