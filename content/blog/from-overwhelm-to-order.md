Every day, I face a mountain of decisions that leave me mentally exhausted before noon. It’s not the big, life-changing choices that weigh me down, but the endless barrage of small, routine ones. Should I go to the gym now or later? What should I eat for dinner? With so many options, even simple tasks start to feel overwhelming.

As it turns out, this constant strain has a name: **decision fatigue**. The more choices we have to make, the more our mental energy drains, leading to stress and poor decision-making. For me, it sometimes feels like it takes forever to make even the simplest choice. Yet, once I’ve finally made a decision, I rarely have to change it.

The key to avoiding this mental exhaustion? Eliminate routine decisions.

## The Conversation That Sparked Change

Earlier this year, I had a conversation with my friend Cam about decision fatigue, and it completely changed my perspective. We were both feeling stuck, not moving forward with our projects or personal goals, and we realized that indecision was the root cause. Since then, I've come to see that many of my stalled ambitions boil down to one thing: an inability to make decisions quickly and confidently.

As Jeff Bezos wisely pointed out, “stress primarily comes from not taking action over something you can control.” For example, right now I’m struggling to choose a new dentist, doctor, and therapist in Stockholm. With so many options and factors to consider, I don’t even know where to begin. It’s frustrating, and the longer I wait, the more stress I feel.

## Finding a Framework to Simplify Decisions

During our chat, Cam suggested something simple but effective: **use a framework** to make decisions easier. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the number of options, I could narrow them down based on specific criteria—like cost, location, and reviews. For example, when choosing a dentist, I could compare metrics such as appointment cost vs. distance from my home. It seems straightforward, but even this can feel overwhelming—picking which metrics to prioritize is another decision in itself!

That’s when I realized: there’s no escaping decisions. But what we can do is systematize the ones that don’t require deep thought. By turning routine choices into automatic actions, we can free up mental energy for the decisions that truly matter.

## The Power of Routines: Deciding Once and Never Again

Here’s how I’ve started to simplify my life. I’ve created routines and automated choices in key areas, reducing the number of decisions I have to make every day. Below, I break down my routines across different aspects of my life, all inspired by Tony Robbins’ **Pyramid of Mastery**, which focuses on personal fulfillment in health, relationships, and business.

These routines may not always be fun or comfortable, but they help me save brainpower for more important decisions.

### Health & Vitality

- **Dumbbell workouts** with Chris and Edi (no gym decision required)
- **Cold shower** after every workout (boosts energy, reduces inflammation)
- **Take the stairs** whenever possible—no more elevator/elevator debates
- **Sleep schedule**: Consistent 10pm–6am, seven days a week
- **Bedroom temperature**: Keep the room at 18°C during the night for better sleep quality
- **Supplements**: Magnesium and Zinc once a day

### Mind & Meaning

- **Daily reading**: A page from *Uncommon Life* (no choice of book needed)
- **Meditation**: Using *Balance* or *Headspace* apps to start the day grounded

### Love & Relationships

- **Weekly check-ins with Cam**: Same time, same day (no planning required)
- **Social media**: I’ll keep it simple—maintaining my current accounts without overthinking them
- **Personal development goal**: Aspire to become a loving father and husband (keeping this as a focus for the future, no decision fatigue here)
- **Household habits**: Cleaning the toilet after use—because small acts matter

### Productivity & Performance

- **Folding clothes**: Using the Marie Kondo method for tidiness and consistency
- **Workweek structure**:
    - **Maker** Monday–Thursday (focus on creative and coding tasks)
    - **Admin** on Friday (inbox zero, admin tasks)
    - **Planner** on weekends (strategize for the week ahead)
- **Phone settings**: Keeping my phone on Do Not Disturb mode to minimize distractions
- **Device settings**: Using **greyscale mode** on all devices to reduce distractions and eye strain

- **Use it till it breaks**: Continuing to use the same tech until it no longer works
- **Apple ecosystem**: Sticking with Apple products for ease and familiarity
- **Gaming**: Grabbing a free game from Epic each week
- **Wishlist**: When I want to buy something, I add it to my *Notion Buying Wishlist* and give it time—do I truly need it or is it just a want?

### Leadership & Impact

- **Content creation**: Sharing insights and reflections on social media platforms
- **YouTube goal**: Committing to 100 YouTube videos as a learning experience—then reassessing its potential for my career

### Small Steps, Big Change

By implementing these routines, I’ve been able to cut down on decision fatigue and reserve my mental energy for more significant choices. As much as possible, I’ve decided once and removed the need to decide again. It’s an ongoing process, but every small step counts toward a more efficient and less stressful life.

The journey to combat decision fatigue isn’t perfect—there’s always more to improve. But with these systems in place, I’m finding it easier to move forward, one decision at a time.
