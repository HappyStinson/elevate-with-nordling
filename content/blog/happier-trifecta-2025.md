## Introduction

I got the idea of writing a "25 for 2025" list from Gretchen Rubin as part of the [Happier Trifecta](https://gretchenrubin.com/design-your-year-2025/ "Design Your Year 2025"). This trifecta offers different strategies to boost happiness and build habits throughout the year. There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all solution to being happier‚Äîthese tools allow you to find what works best for you. Whether you feel energized by the clean slate of January 1, prefer to start your aims when it suits you, or need a boost to keep up your resolutions, you can use these strategies at any time. The best time to start is always now.

(January was a bit hectic for me, so I left it until February 23rd to compile this list.)

### Your Year, Your Way

Gretchen's research and experience show that when we set specific aims that match our personal preferences, energy levels, circumstances, and tendencies, we‚Äôre far more likely to achieve them. After taking Gretchen's [quiz](https://gretchenrubin.com/quiz/ "Take the Happiness Quiz"), I discovered that my tendency is to be a Questioner.

Personally, I‚Äôm not a fan of New Year‚Äôs resolutions, but I love the idea of keeping a solid list of my aims.

### This Year‚Äôs Trifecta

1. **Join the ‚Äú25 in ‚Äô25‚Äù Challenge**
    
    This year, I‚Äôm excited to participate in the ‚ÄúRead 25 in ‚Äô25‚Äù challenge, which encourages reading for 25 minutes every day in 2025. Many people want to read more but find it hard to keep the habit. I‚Äôve already finished several books thanks to this challenge, and I‚Äôm tracking my progress on my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/nordling "View my reading progress").
    
2. **Choose a One-Word Theme for 2025**
    
    Picking a word or phrase to encapsulate my aims for 2025 is a fun and engaging way to focus my intentions, especially since I‚Äôm not a fan of resolutions. In 2024 I chose ‚Äú**Communication**‚Äù as that was an area I wanted to improve in. My theme for this year is "**Longevity**," represented by the infinity symbol (‚àû), which serves as a reminder to make decisions once and stick to them. This theme can help me stay motivated and focused, leading me toward new ideas and unexpected possibilities.
    
    The concept of longevity resonates with me in various ways. It motivates me to adopt healthier eating habits, such as a personal modification of the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/worlds-healthiest-diets/ "Explore the world's healthiest diets") and abstaining from alcohol. I‚Äôve also started walking more and have incorporated a new [bike and bells workout routine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJ0TIYiwZzhIPeV2bwTT-DdgAGNtKo8e "YouTube Playlist") into my life. Additionally, I consume a lot of content revolving around lifestyle choices that promote a long and healthy life. The goal is to build habits that last for 100 years.
    
3. **Write a ‚Äú25 for 2025‚Äù List**
    
    When I set specific aims for myself, I‚Äôm far more likely to achieve them. I‚Äôve taken the time to create a list of 25 things I‚Äôd like to accomplish this year. They can be big or small, enjoyable or challenging, serious or whimsical. I like to include a mix. The important thing is to keep them specific, concrete, and manageable. For example, ‚ÄúTry 25 new recipes‚Äù works better than ‚ÄúBecome an accomplished cook.‚Äù
    
    You can be playful with "2025" by incorporating the numbers 2 and 5 to create different quantities. Focus on actions rather than outcomes. For instance, instead of saying ‚ÄúLearn Italian,‚Äù you might say ‚ÄúPractice Italian for 7 minutes a day.‚Äù
