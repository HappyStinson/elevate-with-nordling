## Introduction

As I approach my 34th birthday, I‚Äôm still on a journey of figuring out who I am. My interests span across music, technology, and the mysteries of the human brain. This post is a mix of reflecting on my progress and sharing experiences that might resonate with or inspire you.

If you asked me what I do right now, I‚Äôd say: I work as a programmer by day and a songwriter by night. I haven‚Äôt had a proper workout in a while‚Äîunless you count moving heavy furniture up and down stairs. I meditate regularly, though focus remains elusive. Australia feels far away, now more than ever. Memento mori.

This post isn‚Äôt just about what I‚Äôve been doing; it‚Äôs about the journey, the small wins, and the ongoing struggles. Whether you‚Äôre here to follow along or find some inspiration for your own path, I hope you get something out of these reflections.

## The Big Rocks

For those unfamiliar with the concept, here‚Äôs a good explanation: ‚ÄúThe Big Rocks are the major things you want to get done this week. A report, launching a new website, going to the gym, spending time with your spouse and kids, achieving your dreams.‚Äù - [Zen Habits](https://zenhabits.net/big-rocks-first-double-your-productivity-this-week/)

My Big Rocks this week.

### 100 Days of Code (Learning Python Programming)

I completed the first 3 days. It was still pretty easy and mostly a repetition of familiar concepts, but I learned some useful things and got ideas for future projects. I‚Äôm looking forward to the remaining 97 days and am curious to see where this challenge will take me.

### Chris & Edi Vitalize 1.0 (8-Week Dumbbell Workout Program)

I tried to figure out a way to get my workouts in without relying on Wi-Fi or mobile data. I signed up for their app but couldn‚Äôt find a way to download the workouts for offline use (I didn't want to spend mobile data at the gym). Then I gave up‚Äîso that was that. It was a shame this made the project bigger than it needed to be.

Still, I believe I‚Äôll gain some benefits that will help me maintain good habits. It seems worth spending on things that help me reach my goals. I compared it with other apps too, but it‚Äôs hard to beat the follow-along workouts with music.

### 5090 Songwriting Challenge (Write 50 Songs in 90 Days)

I didn‚Äôt set much time aside for songwriting this week. I thought about it since I got daily reminders, but I ended up watching TV shows and twiddling my thumbs instead. Still, I‚Äôm keeping this challenge in mind and hope to find more time to dedicate to it soon.

## Personal

### Apartment

I had dinner with one of my neighbors this week. He was really friendly and fun, making me feel more at home in the new place. I also did my first laundry here‚Äîalways a milestone in getting settled.

I continued unboxing and arranging furniture. I still need to tweak some things in the setup and get a feel for how everything fits together. But I‚Äôm sleeping in a bed and working at a standing desk, with a monstera by the window‚Äîwhat more could a bachelor possibly want? üòâ

I also started investigating a mesh Wi-Fi system to improve connectivity throughout the apartment. Especially since the one in the common areas isn't working.

### Health

I finished my bottle of Green Tea supplements this week. Now, I‚Äôm only taking Zinc and Magnesium.

#### Dentist Dilemmas

Finding a dentist has been a struggle. It‚Äôs hard to find one that offers reasonable prices (I'm expecting them to want to do some work...), and I‚Äôve been experiencing some serious decision fatigue. I created a template that I can use to request quotes, which should help narrow down the options.

### Preparing for Spain

I renewed my passport since my previous one expired last year shortly after I returned from Australia. This was part of my preparation for an upcoming trip, and I‚Äôm glad to have it sorted out.


### Nordling.xyz (This Website)

Since sharing this website on Facebook, I received some positive feedback from people I care about, and that means a lot. [Cam](https://camseale.com/) heard me talk with passion and frustration about this project all year and gave me credit for the authentic writing, clean design, and for inspiring him to write as well. The domain name is mine for another 10 years, so it‚Äôs safe to say this could turn into a decade-long project with new posts and small improvements along the way. Feel free to *bookmark* it. üòâ

## Professional

### Work Progress and Challenges

Besides the programming I did in my spare time, I didn‚Äôt make any meaningful progress at work this week. Most of my time was spent in meetings and chasing people on Teams to find someone with the right access to help me investigate further. I tried handing it over to someone else on my team, but it came back to me like a hot potato. ü•µ It‚Äôs really demotivating when things don‚Äôt work out, and I end up spending most of my time troubleshooting (the worst part of being a programmer).

While waiting for a response, I dove into some short courses on Digital Savviness: the data, digital tools and apps, AI tools, and advanced banking knowledge. I earned a few certificates that I might show off on LinkedIn.

### This Week's Learnings

I discovered that Copilot (Microsoft‚Äôs AI assistant) is not as effective as ChatGPT. It keeps messing up my somewhat simple requests, which was a bit disappointing.

## Biggest Win

I haven‚Äôt quite pinned down my biggest win for this week yet.

## Biggest Struggle

Getting to bed on time and waking up at 6 AM for a 2-hour Python session before work has been my biggest struggle. I had all the good intentions but failed miserably.

## Habits

### Helpful

As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm fascinated by the human brain and how it works. I‚Äôve been working on adopting more helpful habits while trying to eliminate the unhelpful ones. Here are a few habits I‚Äôve focused on:

- I enjoy going for long walks + taking the stairs instead of the elevator/escalator when possible.
- I intermittent fast (for longevity, not weight loss) and don't really eat three meals a day. I also try to stop eating before 8 PM. People have preconceived notions about it, and I‚Äôve encountered some confusion. This deserves its own post.
- I‚Äôve started sleeping with my mouth taped to enforce nasal breathing, a habit I picked up again since moving into the apartment.
- When I need to focus on meaningful work, I put my phone on *Do Not Disturb* and place it out of sight (sorry in advance if I don‚Äôt get back to you right away).
- I‚Äôve been tracking most of my thoughts in Notion. I created a whole database dedicated to expense tracking to prevent me from making impulsive purchases. This week, I was eyeing the first iMac computer released in 1999.
- I‚Äôve been getting into the habit of asking ChatGPT for advice on things I know little about. This helps curb my tendency to over-research and combats decision fatigue.

### Unhelpful

On the flip side, I‚Äôve been struggling with procrastination‚Äîsomething I still need to work on.

## Deep Work Sessions (Created)

I read [this article](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work) on deep work, which made me think of better ways to accomplish what‚Äôs important. It inspired me to create more focused work sessions.

I also got a creative urge to finish a [personal message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBKsTYNBGPo) to my songwriting teacher Lo√Øc from JMC after hearing of his sudden passing.

I completed 3 small text-based Python projects as part of my ongoing learning. They‚Äôre nothing worth sharing just yet, but they were good practice.

## Consumed

### Watched

This week, I watched *Skilda V√§rldar* (90's nostalgia‚Äîa milestone in Swedish TV history. Guilty pleasure, but mostly a time-waster). I also watched some table tennis finals‚Äîthis time at the HiQ office. It had more impact on me than I expected; I even dreamed that I was in Japan playing soccer for the national team at the Olympics. lol.

### Listened to

Here‚Äôs two albums that became my soundtrack this week:
- [Suzzies Orkester - Om](https://open.spotify.com/album/3LnNKQXTmNjM4H9ZDs4ZO3?si=NL9YuZs8QaqrGI6RMv9vsw)
- [Miley Cyrus - Endless Summer Vacation](https://open.spotify.com/album/5DvJgsMLbaR1HmAI6VhfcQ?si=9xSLD264R8SDFHClXQ0ofg)

I also listened to the *Genius Blogger* and *Pybites* on creating content.

### Read

I read an article on grayscale screens and decided to try for myself: ‚ÄúIt's a lot easier to maintain your focus when everything on your screen is displayed in shades of gray.‚Äù [How to Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-turn-your-iphone-screen-black-and-white-and-why/).

## Friends and Family

I met a few Christians from South Korea while on my lunch break this week. They showed me a few passages from the Bible, and we had a great chat. I‚Äôm considering catching up with them again for more Bible studies.

I had a nice walk and talk over the phone with my friend Robin who said he's coming to visit soon.

My friends that I hang out with the most are a homogenous group of Caucasian men in their 30s. I‚Äôve been thinking about how I could interact with more women and diversify my social circle.

I had my first video call with Cam in my new room. I was worried I‚Äôd disturb the neighbor, so I spent a long time online looking for good spots to sit. I didn‚Äôt find anything suitable, but it turned out fine to talk in the bedroom anyway‚Äîso I worried for nothing.

This week, I attended The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra‚Äôs annual G√§rdet concert by the Maritime Museum with the meetup group **Stockholm Classical Music Concerts**. It was great seeing Kariem again (we‚Äôve been to two classical concerts in Berwaldhallen earlier this year), and I also met some new cool people with similar interests.

## Closing Thoughts

All in all, I moved the needle slightly forward this week. Posting these updates helps me stay accountable and track my growth, and I hope it resonates with you as well.

Thanks for reading, and here‚Äôs to another week of growth and new experiences!
