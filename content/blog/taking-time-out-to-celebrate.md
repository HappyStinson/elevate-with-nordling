## Preface

I see that I haven't posted anything new since the end of October, and today I’m changing that!  

This is not going to be one of those long “what have I done since last time” kinds of posts. Instead, it’s something shorter to help me complete *something* before I change my mind. If you recall, I have a tendency to get stuck when it comes to making decisions. One consequence is starting many projects but delaying their completion, which leaves me silent for months. In reality, I feel a constant pressure to deliver.  

This realization hit me one night as I lay awake, unable to fall back asleep. I want to become a content creator and practice the art of consistency. However, whenever an idea seems like a “5-minute job,” it rarely is for me. Instead, it stretches into hours, days, weeks, or even months.  

So, what’s the solution? My strategy for the new year is to postpone decision-making until the weekend. On that specific day, I’ll write about whatever topic comes to mind. Don’t expect a recurring series or weekly reviews—those tend to make me overthink. Instead, I want to create content that’s entertaining, inspirational, and personal.

## Topic of the Week: Celebrating Wins

When was the last time you celebrated a win? I mean properly taking a break and saying, “I’m done working for the week. Let’s make a toast to my progress!”  

For me, it’s been a long time. But now, seeing that I’m making progress (not perfection!) recently, I think that’s reason enough to enjoy a healthy meal and a luxurious, non-alcoholic drink.  

### What I’m Celebrating Right Now

**Health & Vitality**
  - After weeks of dealing with fever symptoms, headaches, toothache, and sleep problems since mid-December, I’m finally feeling much better and almost fully recovered. That’s something I’m truly celebrating!
  - I’ve also started the year by returning to my workout habit, being mindful of where I’m at, and not pushing myself too hard.
  - I’m excited to dedicate this year to longevity as I focus on sustainable health habits and long-term well-being.

**Mind & Meaning**
  - I’ve been enjoying the Balance app and have completed over 100 hours of meditation.
  - I’ve practiced my Spanish for over 110 days. ¡Hola amigos!

**Love & Relationships**
  - I spent quality time with my dad and grandma this week.
  - I met my new flatmate, and she seems nice.

**Productivity & Performance**
  - I reached my weekly task goal (50 tasks) in Todoist.

## Closing Thoughts

Talk to you again next weekend when I have something else to share. For now, I’m heading out to walk down a snowy road to pick up some groceries and a nice bottle of something sparkling and luxurious. The perfect way to toast a fresh start and new progress! All the best.
