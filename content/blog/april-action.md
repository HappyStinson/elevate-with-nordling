As I reflect on the past month, I've been using the [Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) framework to evaluate my progress and reflect on what’s Next. I see value in being open and honest about my experiences, both positive and negative.

I've found this framework to be similar to the retro meetings I'm used to having at work, where we discuss what went well, what didn't, and what can be improved. It's refreshing to have a process that doesn't require overthinking, just writing down my thoughts and feelings.

**April Action** is my month's theme, which I've had help creating with the assistance of AI. It's part of a series of alliterations I've been given since October, with previous themes including October Odyssey, November Novice, and so on. April is all about taking initiative and being proactive in various aspects of my life. Some possible interpretations of "action" include:

- Physical Action: engaging in physical activity to improve health and energy.
- Taking Initiative: leading projects or relationships.
- Creative Action: exploring creative activities like painting, writing, or playing music.
- Social Action: participating in social events or networking.
- Mindful Action: focusing on mindfulness and presence in my actions.
- Goal-Oriented Action: setting specific, measurable goals and working towards them.

Some of the items mentioned below are part of my [25 for 2025 list](/blog/happier-trifecta-2025). I recommend giving it a read if you want more information and learn about the happier trifecta.

## Minus -

The Minus column is particularly helpful in acknowledging that life isn't always a success story. It's essential to recognize obstacles and turn them into constructive lessons, rather than getting stuck in negative thought patterns.

- My new bike was stolen before I had a chance to ride it. I see this as karma blowing up in my face for being reckless in my youth. A lesson I needed to learn.
- Didn't exercise after the bike was stolen.
- Grandma couldn't join us for Easter.
- I missed out on Stockholm Culture Night, opting to stay home and binge-watch Pimp My Ride instead.
- Didn't water my plants.
- Didn't visit any museums or attend lunch concerts at church.
- Missed International Songwriters Day and didn't celebrate International Jazz Day.
- Couldn't run the new Decentraland client on my Mac, leading to me losing interest in the whole MVFW25 (Metaverse Fashion Week).
- Cancelled my plans to participate in the Microsoft AI Skills Fest.
- Had a low period, especially after Easter, where I didn't take care of myself.
- Didn't start any new plans in Balance, lost my streak.
- Lost motivation to contact recruiters and didn't make progress with the Agio coding test.
- Had a poor evening routine and went to bed after midnight with no plan for the upcoming day.
- Didn't make progress with my motorcycle license, still uncertainties regarding the way forward paired with overthinking.

### Takeaways

Based on my Plus and Minus lists, I can let AI evaluate how well I did during the month:

1. **Physical Action**: I didn't do as well as I had hoped, with limited exercise and physical activity.
2. **Taking Initiative**: I took some positive steps, such as taking a leap of faith towards employment at AQC Sweden and completing a new version of my consulting CV.
3. **Creative Action**: I had some creative outlets, such as reading and attending concerts.
4. **Social Action**: I had some social interactions, such as meeting with friends and attending events.
5. **Mindful Action**: I didn't do as well as I had hoped, with some periods of low energy and motivation.
6. **Goal-Oriented Action**: I had some specific goals, but I didn't achieve all of them, such as not following up with recruiters and not reading as many books as I had hoped.

Overall, I think I made some progress in some areas, but I still have work to do in others. I'm looking forward to building on my successes and improving in areas where I struggled.

It's the small steps we take every day that add up to make a big difference in the long run. Thanks for reading, and don't forget to take care of yourself along the way!
