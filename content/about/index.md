# About Me

Hi, I’m Rasmus Nordling. I’m a programmer, musician, and content creator based in Stockholm. I enjoy various creative pursuits, including making music, videos, and writing code. 

You can check out my [songs](https://soundcloud.com/happystinson/sets/original-songs), [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@BangersNBiz), and [photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/ras-nordling/). 

I’m passionate about self-care through meditation, exploring new places, and connecting with nature. Currently, I’m embracing life in Stockholm, but I love experiencing new locations.

## My Mission

This site is a space for me to share my journey and insights on achieving goals and personal growth. I started this blog to stay accountable, inspire others, and motivate you to take steps toward your own dreams.

Starting in 2024 I'm now writing on a new website adress *nordling.xyz* and updating my old posts as I move them to this new platform. In the mean time you're more than welcome to poke around my unmaintained [blog archive](https://rasmus-nordling.netlify.app/).
